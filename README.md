# Rhythm Transfer in Music

### Somesh Ganesh

###### Under the guidance of Dr. Alexander Lerch

This is part of my master's project in the music informatics laboratory at the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology.

The aim of this research project is to explore ways to process the rhythm of an input song to the rhythm of a target song. As the project progresses, more details will be added here. 

For any questions, you can reach me at someshg94@gatech.edu
